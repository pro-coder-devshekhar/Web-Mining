Founded in 2003, the brand’s claim to fame was the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, which was launched in 2008. The 2-door electric sports car offered a range of nearly 400km and a 0-100kmph time of under 4 seconds. With over 2,400 sales to its name, the Roadster got the ball rolling for Tesla. Since 2012, the carmaker has expanded its range to include the Model S family sedan and the Model X crossover, with the Model 3 sedan slated to join the family soon. Tesla’s vehicles are produced at its factory in Fremont, California, which is capable of producing 2,000 cars a week. The brand is expected to make its entry into the Indian market in 2018, with the first product launch being the Model 3 sedan – a likely rival to the likes of the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Audi A4 and Jaguar XF.
